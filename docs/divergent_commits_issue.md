You're seeing this message because your local branch and remote branch have diverged, meaning they both have commits that the other doesn't.

You must choose how you want Git to reconcile these changes.

Here are the common ways to resolve it:

### Option 1: **Merge**

Keeps history from both branches by creating a merge commit.

```bash
git pull --no-rebase
```

or to set as default:

```bash
git config pull.rebase false
```

### Option 2: **Rebase** (cleaner history)

Replays your local commits on top of remote commits, creating linear history.

```bash
git pull --rebase
```

or to set as default:

```bash
git config pull.rebase true
```

### Option 3: **Fast-forward only** (most restrictive)

Allows pull only if local branch hasn't diverged (no local commits):

```bash
git pull --ff-only
```

or to set as default:

```bash
git config pull.ff only
```

---

### Recommended Solution:

Typically, if you're working alone or prefer a clean linear history, go with **rebase**:

```bash
git pull --rebase
```

If you're collaborating and want explicit merges recorded, go with **merge**:

```bash
git pull --no-rebase
```

Choose the one most suitable for your workflow, and Git will handle the rest.
